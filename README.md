# Sign-up Form

## Description
My Sign-up form - based on one of my favourite games FF6! Has a brief animation to access form, floating labels and show/hide password feature. Default form behaviour has been disabled in favour of custom responsiveness to filling out required fields and submission.

Built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
